            Git is a version control system that enables developers to track changes in their code, collaborate seamlessly, and manage multiple versions of projects. GitHub is a web-based platform built on Git that enhances collaboration by allowing developers to host their repositories, share code, and contribute to projects from anywhere in the world. The power of collaboration in GitHub lies in its features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking, which foster teamwork, improve code quality, and streamline workflows, making it an essential tool for both individual developers and large teams.
